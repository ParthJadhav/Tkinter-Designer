# Makefiles are traditionally for building C projects... Or something, IDK. Whatever.
# They're a great drop in for shared script runners, keeping cmd syntax brief.

# Declare a PHONY target, write the sequence of commands it executes, then chain them together.
# In your shell just run `make lint` to just run flake8 with the options listed.
# or run `make precommit` to run the lint target script and if it successfully exits then the test target script.

# List of phony make targets
.PHONY: test, lint, build, precommit, cli, gui
